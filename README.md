# SmartHire: A Next-Generation Hiring Platform

Welcome to SmartHire, a web-based application that simplifies and automates the hiring process by allowing applicants to create detailed profiles with all their relevant information and recruiters to post jobs and filter through the applicants based on their eligibility criteria. The app uses machine learning algorithms to match the best candidates for the job and provide recruiters with a list of top candidates, eliminating the need for manual filtering of applications.

## Features

- **Job Postings:** Recruiters can create job postings with eligibility criteria, job description, required skills, responsibilities, salary, and set the duration of the job posting. The job postings should NOT be visible to the applicants.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** The app uses machine learning algorithms to match the best candidates for the job based on their eligibility criteria and generate a score called 'Job Fit Score' or JFS for each applicant for each job posting.
- **Subjective Questions:** The application should have subjective questions that candidates need to answer, eliminating duplicate applications.
- **Tie-Breaking:** If there is a tie between two candidates, the app will consider additional criteria such as subjective questions, experience, and other relevant factors.
- **Candidate Feedback:** To further improve the UX, the app should provide feedback to candidates on their application status, improving the candidate experience. It should also let them know about what skills they are missing, what skills are in high demand, salary statistics, why they didn't get shortlisted for a certain job posting, etc.
